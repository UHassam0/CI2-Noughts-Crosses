This is a simple noughts and crosses game where the computer places its token randomly. Making it very easy

## Features

A noughts and crosses game

## Testing and validation

### Bugs

+ clicking already filled box runs functions and adds aditional computer token

+ allows cicking while form/modal is open

+ calls winner before inputting token



+ says game over - stalemate when board full even if shows a winner


+ I've had to define empty too many times

+ doesn't really seem to work overall

+ not centre aligned on media queries?

### Solved Bugs

+ Incorrect win definitions - corrected win definitions - using brackets and corrected one reference to the wrong box. The ands needed containig in brackets as they were mixing with the ors for the different possibilities

+ relies on user to reset board - created reload function - currently only called when game reaches stalemate - will adjust to be called with button. remove for now

+ checks for winner adn can call winner for blank spaces -
